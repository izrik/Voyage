chain apps, eg:
    class CoreApp : VoyageApp

        [Resource("/child/")]
        public ChildApp Child = new ChildApp();

        public class ChildApp : VoyageApp 

            [Resource("item")]
            public object GetItem(...)
                return ...

    then, a path of "/child/item" on CoreApp gets routed to
    ChildApp.GetItem with a ap-specific path of "item" or "/item"
